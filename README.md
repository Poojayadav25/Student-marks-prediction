# Student marks predicton

Student Marks Predictor is machine learning model which is based on business problem. here students can predict their marks according to their study hour to achive good marks , We use linear regression algorithum to solve this business problem. we have two parameters study_hours and student_marks where student_marks is based on study_hours so student_hour is independent and student_marks is dependent we use scatter graph to visualize data.

by the visualization of scatter graph be pedict that data is in linear state #Libraries used.. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Joblib



## Features


I created a student marks prediction model with the help of following few steps like :

1. Define project objectives
2. Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning , Data Preparation , split into train and test , Feature Scaling).
3. Model Selection
4. Data Collection
5. Data Visualization
6. Model Building
7. Deploy Model
